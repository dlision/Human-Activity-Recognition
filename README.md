# Human Activity Recognition using smartphone Data

## Required Python Libraries

* python => 3.7
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn

Note: You can install above libraries uning pip or conda.

## Dataset Descrption
Human activity recognition using smartphone data using dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, They captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

## Algorithm Descrption
For project demontration we used logestic regression for human activity recognition. Logistic regression is a statistical analysis method to predict a binary outcome, such as yes or no, based on prior observations of a data set. A logistic regression model predicts a dependent data variable by analyzing the relationship between one or more existing independent variables.
