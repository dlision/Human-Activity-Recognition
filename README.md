# Human Activity recognition using smartphone Data sets
Demonstrate Machine Learning Algorithm using the Human activity recognition using 
smartphone data using dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The experiments
have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone 
(Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we 
captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset 
has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for 
generating the training data and 30% the test data.
